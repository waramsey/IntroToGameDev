"Power Crystals"
- break = reset a timer
- boss has better stats for each crystal remaining
- if timer hits 0, you are summoned to the boss room instantly


Summoned by progressively tougher bosses.  The boss is NOT a part of the floor layout.
 - if power crystals are all broken, summoned to boss of floor (at weakest state)
 - if time runs out, summoned to boss
